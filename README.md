Simple tool for plotting and investigating multiple quadratic equations

Written to help a high school student visualise some quadratic equations while studying.
You can plot as many equations on the same pliot as your like.
You can enter the coefficients for the plots either in the source, or be prompted via the command line.

Apart from the actual plots, the code also calculates some basic feartures of the equation, including:
The discriminant
The turning point
What the roots of the equation (if any) are.

Requires only matplot lib do do the plotting.

I'm tempted to make a proper desktop GUI for it, or maybe host it as a web service instead.  The latter would probably result in an easier to use / share tool, but would remove the ability ro use it stand-alone without an internet connection.
